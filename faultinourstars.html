     <br>
     <p>Hazel Grace is just a normal teenager who is bored with life and likes to quote philosophers (no big deal) when she meets Augustus, a grade A hottie. It would be your typical teenage-girl-meets-boy story if it weren't for the particulars of how they meet: Hazel and Augustus first lay eyes on each other at a support group for kids with cancer. Ugh.

        This is a love story in the bleakest sense. Usually when teenagers fall for each other, it's all exhilaration and excitement and promises of forever. But even though Hazel Grace and Augustus experience that kind of giddy obsession with each other (and trust us, it's pretty freakin' cute), their relationship is, well, a little complicated by their medical statuses. You see, they live in an era where they've been able to slow the progress of their tumors, but not totally get rid of them. So for kids like Hazel Grace and Augustus, the future is one big question mark.
        
        More than anything, this book is about coming to terms with your own mortality. All the characters in the book handle it in different ways: there are glass-half-full support group kids who try to get in touch with their spirituality and inner strength; there are parents who try to keep their premature grief in check; there are people like Augustus who want to make a mark on the world; and there are people like Hazel Grace who just float along without making a fuss about dying or living either way.
        
        In the end, no way is right or wrong. And no way is easy.
        
        So pick up your own tear-stained, dog-eared copy of The Fault in Our Stars and let's fall in love, cry, and learn from all the trials and tribulations that come with dying... and of course, living.
        
         
        What is The Fault in Our Stars About and Why Should I Care?
        Why should I care? This might as well be a question that's asked by the book's narrator, Hazel Grace. Quite frankly, Hazel doesn't see much of a point in life or leaving a mark on the world. But even if she remains passive, life still happens to her. And that's where all the interesting stuff starts to happen. John Green strives to show us all the messy, wonderful, and utterly surprising things that can happen in a life, even if you're not actively seeking out any adventures. Hazel Grace's life is far from perfect, even when she meets the dreamboat Augustus and falls madly in love with him. It's full of breathing tubes and worried parents and former classmates who treat her like she's fragile glass. But it's still a life, and that's the truly important part.
        
        The book challenges you, the reader, to examine your own life and what you want out of it. After all, even with their obvious limitations, the characters in this book demand control of their lives and try to make the most of the time they have—even if it turns out to be not so much time at all.</p>

      <br>
      <p>Hazel Grace Lancaster starts her story by telling us that her mother thinks she's depressed. Hazel doesn't deny that she's a little fixated on death. She considers just about everything, including her cancer, a side effect of dying. Her mother and doctor agreed she should attend a weekly cancer support group. The leader of the support group is a cancer survivor named Patrick who constantly talks about the fact that they meet in the heart of Jesus since the group meets in the basement of a cross-shaped church, directly at the spot where Jesus’ heart would be. Despite his surviving cancer, Hazel views his life as dreary. In the meeting, Hazel introduces herself. She is sixteen and originally had thyroid cancer, though it's spread to her lungs, too. Hazel equates the sharing part of group to a circle jerk of support where everyone talks about how they're winning the fight. The only part of support group she likes is a guy named Isaac who lost an eye to cancer and may lose his remaining eye as well. They both sigh derisively at people's stories.

        After a few weeks, Hazel attends a meeting where she's surprised by the presence of a new and beautiful boy who stares directly at her. His name is Augustus Waters, and he's attending the meeting to support Isaac, who discovered he will soon lose his second eye to cancer. Augustus is a survivor of osterosarcoma, and when asked what he fears, he says “oblivion.” Hazel, who rarely speaks, says to the group that eventually everyone will be dead, and everything humanity has built will have been for naught. In her narration she explains she learned this from her favorite novel, An Imperial Affliction by Peter Van Houten. When the meeting wraps up Isaac introduces Augustus and Hazel. Augustus says Hazel reminds him of Natalie Portman in “V for Vendetta.” The two flirt, mock the meeting's location in the “literal” heart of Jesus, and watch Isaac make out with his girlfriend, Monica. Placing a cigarette between his lips, Augustus invites Hazel to his place, to watch “V For Vendetta.” Hazel is disgusted by the cigarette but reconsiders when Augustus explains that he never lights it. Rather, he enjoys the metaphorical resonance of putting something that kills between his teeth and denying it the power to kill him.</p>
