     <br>
     <p>Paulo Coelho's The Alchemist was first published in Portuguese in 1988 in the author's home country, Brazil. It wasn't exactly a bestseller, but it exploded into an international bestseller when the English translation appeared in 1993. It has sold over 65 million copies and counting worldwide and has been translated into almost over languages. Want to read The Alchemist in your native Kannada? Go for it.

      In Coelho´s version, a Spanish shepherd dreams of a treasure at the Egyptian pyramids. He meets a crazy old man who claims to be a king and tells him to go for his destiny (usually a bad idea), and then travels through Northern Africa. On his journey, he meets a good-looking girl at an oasis, is captured by warriors, and makes contact with a real, live alchemist. If this story sounds familiar, that's because it's a retelling of "The Ruined Man who Became Rich Again through a Dream," a story from One Thousand and One Nights, in The Alchemist. (Yeah, it didn't sound familiar to us, either.)
      
      Anyway, this plot summary probably clues you into why the book is so famous: it's one part novel and about ten parts live-your-dream self-help book. Think The Secret. As the protagonist learns lessons about fulfilling his "Personal Legend," you can apply them to his or her own life, finally manifesting those One Direction tickets you've been wanting. (Or college acceptance, whatevs.)
      
      Of course, any book that makes its author ridiculous wealthy is going to have its detractors. Critics call Coelho a sell-out and his philosophy empty.
      
      We've got a feeling that Coelho forgets those naysayers on his way to the bank.</p>

     <br>
     <p>The Alchemist follows the journey of an Andalusian shepherd boy named Santiago. Believing a recurring dream to be prophetic, he asks a Gypsy fortune teller in the nearby town about its meaning. The woman interprets the dream as a prophecy telling the boy that he will discover a treasure at the Egyptian pyramids.</p>

      <br>
      <p>The third-person narrator describes a shepherd named Santiago arriving with his flock at an abandoned Church. Santiago decides to sleep there. A giant sycamore tree grows in the spot where a sacristy once stood. While Santiago sleeps, he has a disturbing dream (we do not learn exactly what the dream was). When he wakes, his flock begins to stir, and Santiago talks to the sheep about a girl he met the year prior. She is the daughter of a merchant who Santiago is visiting to sell some wool.

        When Santiago arrives, the merchant asks him to wait until afternoon to sell him wool. While Santiago reads, he meets the merchant’s daughter and talks to her about life in the village. She asks why he chooses to be a shepherd even though he can read. Santiago avoids the question, preferring instead to talk about his travels. Santiago finds the merchant’s daughter’s Moorish eyes and raven-colored hair entrancing. He experiences for the first time a desire to stay in one place for the rest of his life. When the merchant finally appears, he asks Santiago for the wool of four sheep and tells him to return the next year.
        
        The story jumps forward in time almost a year, to four days before Santiago’s next visit to the village. He stays in the abandoned church and daydreams about the merchant’s daughter. As he urges his sheep along, he admires their loyalty. Santiago imagines he could kill his sheep one by one, and each one would be none the wiser until he killed it. He feels troubled by his thought, and that night has the same troubling dream he had the year before.
        
        Santiago recalls the day he told his father he wanted to travel instead of becoming a priest. His father told him that travelers see other lands, but do not change as a result. They just end up being nostalgic for the past. His father said the only people of their class who travel are shepherds. The next day, Santiago’s father gave him three gold coins to purchase a flock of sheep. He encouraged Santiago to travel, but said Santiago would learn that their own countryside is best. As he recalls the scene, Santiago senses that his father also would have liked to travel, but could not afford to while raising a family. Santiago wonders if his sheep enjoy discovering new roads and sights each day, but decides they only care about eating. He compares the flock’s single-mindedness to his own preoccupation with the merchant’s daughter. Suddenly, Santiago remembers that an old woman in the nearby village of Tarifa interprets dreams. He decides to visit her.</p>
